    Repository names should be self explanatory, and they are unique to your account, so don't worry about having the same name as someone else!
    
    Here are some example repository names: 

    - `23s-asiaam-191a-labs`
    
    - `23s-191a-assignments`
    
    - `aa191-assignments`


Keep the repository ==Public==, which is in the spirit of sharing, collaboration, and allows anyone to see and improve the code:
