# FETCH and THEN

Time to dive back into scary JavaScript waters! Before doing so, `let`'s just make sure we are warmed-up for our swim!

## Back to JavaScript variables again!

??? note "Need a variable refresher?"
    #### Revisiting more variable definitions

    What we really need to understand about variables is that they act like ==boxes== where you can **store** or **take** information out of.
    - `const` acts like a locked safe that will not let you put anything into it after you define it
    - `let` is like a regular box.
    -  `var` is `VARy` problematic because it can be both locked and unlocked

    Here are some of the types in JavaScript:

    ```js
    //number
    let box1 = 5;
    let box2 = 5.0;

    //string
    let box3 = 'five';
    let box4 = "five";

    // string literal, uses backticks and ${variable} to bring in another variable
    let box5 = `this is from box #4: ${box4}`;

    // array, which is a list of things
    let box6 = [1,2,3,4,5]; 

    // Object, stores variables together, can be of different types!
    let box7 = {"number": 'five', "value":5};

    // boolean (true or false)
    let box8 = true;

    // null value
    let emptyBox;
    ```

    Remember, to declare a variable or give it a value you must use the  ==`=`== symbol, like so:

    ```js
    let my_variable = "exist!";
    ```

    !!! notes "Anatomy of a variable declaration"
        - `let` is the keyword declaration of a variable
        - `my_variable` is the variable's name
        - `"exist!"` is the value for this variable
        - `;` defines the end of a line in JavaScript 

    ```

## JavaScript Warm-up: Using Variables

Instead of hard coding the values, we can use variables to store the values. For example, instead of writing:
```js
const map = L.map('the_map').setView([34.0709,-118.444], 5);
```

We can write:
```js
// declare the variables
let mapCenter = [34.0709,-118.444]
const zoom = 5

// declare the map and use the variables above
const map = L.map('the_map').setView(mapCenter, zoom);
```

This is a little more work, but it is much easier to change the values later. For example, if we wanted to change the map center, we can just change the value of `mapCenter` instead of having to change the value in multiple places.

### Finished warm-up code

```js title="js/init.js" linenums="1" hl_lines="1-3 6"
// declare the variables
let mapCenter = [34.0709,-118.444]
const zoom = 5

// declare the map and use the variables above
const map = L.map('the_map').setView(mapCenter, zoom);

L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {

}).addTo(map);

addMarker(37,-122,'home','home land!')
addMarker(32,-118,'work','where i work land!')
addMarker(39,-119,'location 1','random location')
addMarker(36,-120,'location 2','another random location')

// create a function to add markers
function addMarker(lat,lng,title,message){
    console.log(message)
    L.marker([lat,lng]).addTo(map).bindPopup(`<h2>${title}</h2> <h3>${message}</h3>`)
    return message
}
```

### JavaScript `Objects` - Boxing-up our variables

An `object` is a unique variable that can store many other variables! Think of it as a big box where many other Lego pieces or even other boxes can be put inside!

>   ```js 
>   let myJavaScriptObject = {"key_name": "value", "key_2_name":"value"}
>   ```

Your object can look like this too:

>    ``` js
>        let myJavaScriptObject = {
>            "key_name": "value", 
>            "key_2_name":"value"
>            };
>    ```

??? question "Wait! Didn't we see this somewhere?"
    Yep! It was in the GeoJSON we created!

??? done "The meaning behind GeoJSON"
    GeoJSON actually stands for **"geographic"** **JavaScript Object Notation**! :exploding_head:

In a **JavaScript object**, each value has a `key` and a `value`. 

The `:` symbol seperates the `key` from the `value`, like this:

```js

let myObject = {"key":"value"};

```

- Everything in an object is contained within the curly braces `{}`
- Anything to **left** of the `:` is the key
- Anything to **right** of the `:` is the value
- New **key-value pairs** are separated by a comma, `,`
- **:warning: Warning :warning:**! Never end an object with a `,`!!!!

### Accessing an object's property

To access an `object`'s properties we use the `.` notation.

For example, `myObject.key` will return the value, which in this case is.. `value`!

!!! warning "No :rocket: spaces :ringed_planet: in variable names!"
    You **cannot** use spaces in variable definitions like `let my map;`, so stick with `camelCase` or `snake_case` when naming varibles with multiple words. When defining `key`s in `objects`, you can use spaces, but it is not recommended. 
    
    If you do encounter a `key` with a space in it, like, `#!js let anObject = "my annoying key": "is this"`, you cannot use the `.` syntax to access it you must use this alternative method:
    `#!js anObject["my annoying key"]`

### ⚽In-class Exercise #1 - Variables and console.log

!!! tldr "Tasks"
    1. Re-copy this week's lab template with `index.html` and `init.js`
    2. Replace the hard coded values of `const map = L.map('the_map').setView(mapCenter, zoomLevel);` with an `object`.
    3. Get the `object` to show up in the console.

!!! hint "Reminder: Working with our Dev Console"

    In VS Code, start ==Live Server== by clicking :octicons-broadcast-16: `Go Live`.

    After Firefox runs, open the **Console**:

    - You can either ==right click== anywhere on a page with the mouse and ==clicking== on `Inspect` or press ++f12++ on the keyboard.

    Remember to think of the **Console** as the Command Line/Terminal for your browser.

??? check "Answer"
    Your code should look like the following:

    ```js
        let mapOptions = {'center': [34.0709,-118.444],'zoom':5}
        const map = L.map('the_map').setView(mapOptions.center, mapOptions.zoom);
        console.log(mapOptions)
    ```

    1. In the console, type in ==`mapOptions`== (or whatever you chose to name your object) then press ++enter++. 
    
    2. You should see your JavaScript object, `mapOptions`!

!!! question "Reflection"
    Think about the benefits of having variables in an object, is it easier to read for you? Harder?

Knowing how to check the console will help us test our JavaScript code and even run functions and methods without leaving the browser!


### Finished Exercise #1 code
Make sure your code looks like the following before moving on:

```js title="js/init.js" linenums="1" hl_lines="1 4"
let mapOptions = {'center': [34.0709,-118.444],'zoom':5}

// declare the map and use mapOptions
const map = L.map('the_map').setView(mapOptions.center, mapOptions.zoom);

L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
    attribution: '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
}).addTo(map);

addMarker(37,-122,'home','home land!')
addMarker(32,-118,'work','where i work land!')
addMarker(39,-119,'location 1','random location')
addMarker(36,-120,'location 2','another random location')

// create a function to add markers
function addMarker(lat,lng,title,message){
    console.log(message)
    L.marker([lat,lng]).addTo(map).bindPopup(`<h2>${title}</h2> <h3>${message}</h3>`)
    return message
}
```

## A **method** to my madness?!

With that refresher about `variables` and practice with `objects` in mind, do you remember how our **`functions`** in last week's lab took a `variable` and did something to it?

Variables have built-in **functions** called `method`s!!!

For example, `string`-type variables have `methods` for changing the string, like making all the letters `UPPERCASE` or splitting a character based on a ` `. To access a method, you use the `.` after the variable has been declared as that type.

!!! important "Calling methods for what they are `()`"
    Since **`methods`** *are* **functions**, you must call them in the same way with the `()` at the end. This is because some `methods` have parameters you can fill in.

!!! done "A helping `console` hand!"
    You can check what methods are available right in Firefox's ==web developer console==! Most modern web browsers have this feature as well.

To give this a try, copy and paste this right into your web browser and see what happens!

```js 
let myString = "hi, this is a test string"
let divideBySpace = myString.split(" ")
console.log(divideBySpace) 
```

??? done "Did you get this response?"
    ```result: Array(6) [ "hi,", "this", "is", "a", "test", "string" ]``` 
    
    If you did, yay! This is an array (list), of 6 strings!


### ⚽In-class Exercise #2 - What other methods are available?

As with all languages, learning to look-up things is important to expand what you can say and do! 
The following is a table of where you can find some methods:

|Location|Type|
|--------|----|
|[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Useful_string_methods)|Strings|
|[W3](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp)|Strings|
|[W3](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_number_methods.asp)|Numbers|
|[W3](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp)|Arrays|
|[W3](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_methods.asp)|Objects|

!!! tldr "Tasks"

    1. Visit one of the links above or search online to find other methods.
    2. Get the result to display in your console.
    3. Bonus: read the [next section](#method-chaining) try to `chain` multiple `methods` together.

??? check "Answer"

    Here is an example of an uppercase method:

    ```js 
    let myString = "hi, this is a test string"
    let divideBySpace = myString.toUpperCase()
    console.log(divideBySpace) 

    ```

    Result:

    ``` "HI, THIS IS A TEST STRING" ```

### Method chaining

In JavaScript whenever you see a `.` after a parenthesis`()`,it means you are ==chaining== a function to follow it. 

For example:

```js 

let myString = "hi this is a test string"
let divideBySpace = myString.toUpperCase().split(" ")
console.log(divideBySpace)

```

The output should look a little bit different than last time thanks to the `#!js toUpperCase()` method!

??? done "Output"
    `Array(6) [ "HI", "THIS", "IS", "A", "TEST", "STRING" ]`

## Time to `fetch` and `then` do something

To access data, we will use the JavaScript [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) to **`fetch`** our GeoJSON file and **`then`** add it to our map.

When we access the GeoJSON file with the `Fetch` API we then get many `methods` to use with it.

A `fetch` looks like this:

`#!js fetch("map.geojson")`

!!! question "Wait! No `variable` declaration?! :cry:"
    Why do you think so?

??? check "Answer"
    The `fetch` API is actually a built-in function for `JavaScript`, much like `console.log()`!

### Good? Let's carry on `then`!

`fetch` actually does nothing by itself! It needs to do something with the data. Thus, `fetch` is almost always used together with the `then` method as follows:

``` js
fetch("map.geojson") //(1)! 
    .then(function aGenericDataFunctionName(data){//(2)!
        return data.json()//(3)!
    })
    .then(function anotherGenericDataFunctionName(data){ //(4)!
        // Basic Leaflet method to add GeoJSON data
        L.geoJSON(data).addTo(map)//(5)!
    });
```

1.     `map.geojson` is location of the GeoJSON file relative to our file. If you moved the file to a subdirectory called `data`, then you would have to make this `data/map.geojson`.
2.     Here is our first chain, we are trying to `fetch` our **geojson** file. We will call a `generic` function in here.
3.     For the next step we need a `json`, so we `return` the value as a `json` with the `.json()` method!
4.     This is the next `then` i.e. our second chain!
5.     This calls `L.geoJSON()` and adds our `data` to the map.

### Anoynmous `functions`

Since our `.then` is a one-time call, it does not need named functions as a part of it! 

So we can make our `function` **anoymous** by ==removing the name== part of it.

Here's how the simpler `fetch-then` should look:

``` js
fetch("map.geojson")
    .then(function (data){
        return data.json()
    })
    .then(function (data){
        // Basic Leaflet method to add GeoJSON data
        L.geoJSON(data).addTo(map)
    });
```

Looks much better, right? Well... We can shorten it even more!!!

### WHAT IS THIS `=>` :rage:?!!!

The `=>` is a shortcut to define an `anoynmous` function and is called an `arrow-function`!

Here is how it looks in practice:

```js 
fetch("map.geojson") //(1)! 
    .then(response => { //(2)! 
        return response.json();
    })
    .then(data =>{ //(3)!
        // Basic Leaflet method to add GeoJSON data
        L.geoJSON(data).addTo(map)//(4)!
    });
```

1.     `map.geojson` is location of the GeoJSON file relative to our file. If you moved the file to a subdirectory called `data`, then you would have to make this `data/map.geojson`.
2.     Here is our first chain, we are trying to `fetch` our **geojson** file.
3.     This is our next chain, we are trying to add it to our map!
4.     The `addTo(map)` is similar to our `marker.addTo(map)` function call!

The map should now have a blue tint over it and you cannot interact with it. Not really useful.

Going forward we will use the `arrow-function` because it is shorter, but if you want to use the other methods, feel free to.

## 🏁Checkpoint

Before moving on, check to see if JavaScript code looks like the following:

```js title="js/init.js" linenums="1" hl_lines="2 5 18-25"
// declare variables
let mapOptions = {'center': [34.0709,-118.444],'zoom':5}

// use the variables
const map = L.map('the_map').setView(mapOptions.center, mapOptions.zoom);

L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
    attribution: '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
}).addTo(map);

// create a function to add markers
function addMarker(lat,lng,title,message){
    console.log(message)
    L.marker([lat,lng]).addTo(map).bindPopup(`<h2>${title}</h2> <h3>${message}</h3>`)
    return message
}

fetch("map.geojson")
    .then(response => {
        return response.json();
    })
    .then(data =>{
        // Basic Leaflet method to add GeoJSON data
        L.geoJSON(data).addTo(map)
    });
```
