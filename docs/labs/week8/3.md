# Adding a new Leaflet JavaScript Plugin

The optional part of the previous lab was to change the basemap. 

Taking that one step further we can add brand-new functionality to our maps.

While the [Leaflet provider](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/) is a plug-in of basemaps for Leaflet, there are many plugins that we can use to add extra functionality to our mapplication in JavaScript as well.
Here are some examples:

## Visualizations
- [Turf.js](turfjs.org/)
- [Charts](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/samples/bar/vertical.html)

## Functions
- [Scrollama](https://russellgoldenberg.github.io/scrollama/sticky-side/)

## Leaflet Related
- [Leaflet Plugins](https://leafletjs.com/plugins.html)
- [Leaflet Cluster Markers](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster)

To keep things simple, we will add a cluster marker functionality to our Leaflet map. Clustering makes it easier to see when multiple points are in the same area.

With just a few changes our map will look as follows:
![](./media/clustermarker.png)

As with when we first used Leaflet we need to include the library, so in our html add the following lines:
>index.html
```html
        <!-- Cluster Marker's CSS -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet.markercluster@1.4.1/dist/MarkerCluster.css" />
        <!-- Cluster Marker's JavaScript -->
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet.markercluster@1.4.1/dist/leaflet.markercluster.js"></script>
```

Next, let's read the documentation on how to use the `cluster maker`:

![](./media/clustermarker2.png)

Judging from this code, we might be able to simply change our group layers for the markers!

Head over to our `init.js` file and find the following lines for our group layers:

```js title="js/init.js" linenums="1"
let vaccinated = L.featureGroup();
let nonVaccinated = L.featureGroup();
```

Change it to:

```js title="js/init.js" linenums="1"
let vaccinated = L.markerClusterGroup();
let nonVaccinated = L.markerClusterGroup();
```

And... wow that's it!

This flexibility is what makes opensource tools and plugins so great! However, be warned that not all plugins will be as simple to plug and play.

Congrats!
