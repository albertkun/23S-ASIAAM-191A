# Hello Leaflet... For realz..

## Returning home to the HTML/CSS/JS analogy 

Recall from last week's lab (before things went downhill) and the pre-lab [reading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/The_web_and_web_standards#html_css_and_javascript) that a webpage is like a house:

- HTML is the scaffolding/foundation of the house
- CSS is the paint, carpets, etc. that makes the house look nice
- JavaScript is the **appliances** that adds function to the house

Today we will be focusing on the **appliances** in more detail.

### Why start with HTML and CSS first?

In order to do any JavaScript coding, you need to make sure your content has a place to show up! Additionally, with [Leaflet](https://www.leafletjs.com), we actually need to bring in Leaflet's CSS and JavaScript files into our HTML house. Recall that last week, the map did not show up because I forgot to include Leaflet!

Also, recall that we can bring in Leaflet by **externally linking** just like we did with our CSS (`styles/style.css`)!

## Prepping our HTML

Let's keep all our content in the `.main` class, but move all our portfolio information into a new `div` element with an `id` of `contents`, which looks like this:

```html hl_lines="2 4"
        <div class="main">
            <div id="contents">
                <!-- hint: the majority of lab 1 assignment can go here --> <!-- (1)! -->
            </div>
        </div>
```

1.     You should be able to paste the `main` contents of your first lab assignment here.

!!! note "Compatibility with Lab assignment #1"
    If you are using your `week1` lab assignment, you can copy and paste anything with the `div` elements inside the hint! Of course, this will not work if you have different `div` or changed the `css` too much! Adapt as needed!

In our `index.html` ==header== tag right before `</header>`, we will need to add the Leaflet.js library. We add it right before the end to make sure they are the last items to load before the body starts loading.

### Linking Leaflet.js files

```html title="index.html"
<!-- Leaflet's css-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.css" />

<!-- Leaflet's JavaScript-->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.js"></script>
```

### Adding `the_map` container

In our body, our map needs a **PLACE** to go, so let's add a `<div>` for our map.

!!! info "`divs` vs. `spans`, what's the `DIV`fference?"
    `divs` are generic `HTML elements` that stand for `division` of content, you can think of them as boxes of content. `Spans` are like divs, but for text content.
	Check out [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) for more information:

    - [`elements`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element)
    - [`divs`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div)
    - [`spans`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span)  

After the `<div id="contents"></div>` element, add a new `<div></div>` element, and give it an **ID** attribute of `the_map` like the follwing:

```html
<div id="the_map"></div>
```

Our current `index.html` should look like the following:

```html title="index.html" linenums="1" hl_lines="10 11 12 13 14 23 25 26"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hello World</title>
        <!-- hint: remember to change your page title! -->
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <link rel="shortcut icon" href="#">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css">

        <!-- Leaflet's css-->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.css" />

        <!-- Leaflet's JavaScript-->
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.js"></script>
    </head>
    
    <body>
        <header>
            <!-- hint: you can make a menu with other links here if you'd like -->
        </header>
        
        <div class="main">
            <div id="contents">
                <!-- hint: the majority of lab 1 assignment can go here -->
            </div>
            <div id="the_map"></div>
        </div>
        <div id="footer">
            Copyright(2022)
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Prepping the CSS

Let's incorporate our new `div` that has the `id` of`the_map` into our CSS now.

#### Adding `the_map` container

``` css 
#the_map{ /* (1)! */
    height:80vh; /* (2)! */
    grid-area: main_map;/* (3)! */
}
```

1.       `#the_map` tells this CSS selector to look for an `ID` called ==`the_map`==
2.       `height` defines how tall this `div` should be, `80vh` means 80% of the vertical height.
3.       We are going to name this `grid-area` the following: `main_map` it will be referenced in the `.main` class, but you can name it whatever you want; just be consistent.

!!! question "Why `height: 80vh;`?" 
    For Leaflet's map to show, it must have a height defined in order to show up. So you can play around with the height in your assignments, but be sure to include some height!!
#### Putting `the_map` `id` into our main `class`

Find our previous CSS style for the `main-content` it should be a class called `main`. Remember, because it is a `class` it starts with a `.` NOT a `#` like IDs do!

!!! info "IDs vs. Classes"
    - IDs: There can only be ONE unique ID on a HTML page and in **CSS** you refer to it with a `#`, like `#the_map`.
    - Classes: There can be multiple classes on an HTML page and in **CSS** you refer to it with a `.`

``` css hl_lines="3 4"
.main{
    grid-area: main_content;
    grid-template-areas: "content" "main_map";
	display: grid;
}
```

Our CSS should look like the following:

```css hl_lines="20 21 28 29 30 31" title="styles/style.css"

body{
    display: grid;
    /* grid-template-columns: 1fr;  */
    grid-auto-rows: auto 1fr;
    grid-template-areas: "header" "main_content" "footer";
    background-color: aqua;
    /* height: 100vh; */
}

header{
    grid-area: header;
}

#footer{
    grid-area: footer;
}

.main{
    grid-area: main_content;
    grid-template-areas: "content" "main_map";
	display: grid;
}

#contents{
    grid-area: content;
}

#the_map{
	height:80vh;
    grid-area: main_map;
}
```

With our container ready to go, open up the JavaScript file again and add the following Leaflet code template:

```js title="js/init.js" linenums="1"
console.log("Hello Asia-Am 191A! :)")

// JavaScript const variable declaration
const map = L.map('the_map').setView([34.0709, -118.444], 15); // (1)!

// Leaflet tile layer, i.e. the base map
L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
	attribution: '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
}).addTo(map); // (2)!

//JavaScript let variable declaration to create a marker
let marker = L.marker([34.0709, -118.444]).addTo(map) // (3)!
		.bindPopup('Math Sciences 4328 aka the Technology Sandbox<br> is the lab where I work in ')
		.openPopup();

```

1.     `L.` is the `Leaflet` class that allows us to use built-in Leaflet tools. The `.` is like a chain of commands, but similar to `css`, Leaflet wants us to know `where our map is!` In the documentation, the map constructor expects an ID, which we called `the_map`. We then use `setView` to set the `Latitude (y)`, `Longitude (x)`, and `Zoom` of the initial map.
2.     We use a `L.tilelayer` class to add a basemap to our map.
3.     We use the `L.marker` to add a point to our map. Notice there is no `;` here because the code continues.

Can you see the usage of latitude and longitude in the code?

!!! info "What is latitude and Longitude"
    - [Latitude](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/latitude.html) ranges from -90.0 to 90.0 and measures the distance north or south from the equator (**y-axis**).
    - [Longitude](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/longitude.html) ranges from -180 to 180 measures distance east or west of the prime meridian (**x-axis**).

## What is `L.map` and `L.tile`?
`L.map` is Leaflet's lingo for its own mapping Application Programming Interface (API). Every API has its own unique language to utilize it. You can think of it as an adapter to plug in your smart phone or laptop! Each plug has a different way to connect! To learn more about Leaflet's API visit here:
[https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html)

## ‚öΩ Class Exercise #2 - Adding more markers

!!! tldr "Tasks"
    1. Add some new markers!
    2. Customize the initial map
    3. Optional: change the base map or add some `html` into the marker popups.

Looking at the code above a little bit, we can see some latitude/longitude pairs. Your task is to copy the marker code add more markers of your choosing. 

!!! warning "Unique variable names"
    When you create new marker variables, you **must** ==give the marker variable a new name==, like `marker2` or you will simply override the previous marker! :sob: 

To find latitude/longitude of coordinates, you can use this website or another tool or your choosing:

  - [https://www.latlong.net/](https://www.latlong.net/)

### Optional: Not happy with the basemap?

See if you can switch the basemap out by visiting the following link and changing `L.tileLayer` on your map:
