## Lab

- [Working together with GitHub and plugins](../labs/week8/index.md)
- [Group Surveys](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZAr9Hd9fmtevEGRadA_a4xl-AoXM8eZJ3VQFygXnT5o/edit#gid=1286602102)
  - Remember to take each survey as the memo's persona (or as yourself if it's applicable) and make sure as a group you take it 3 times total. If your group has 3 people, then everyone just needs to take the survey once.
