# 📝Lab Assignment #4 - Loops and APIs

## Due 5/16 Tuesday

In this week's lab, we learned how to loop through data and connect to an API. Your task is to create a mini-version of the final group project for the class that takes in data and maps it.

The requirements are:

- Use any type of [for-loop](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp) within a [JavaScript function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/Function) that adds API data from your Google Spreadsheet form.
- Add data from Google Spreadsheets into your map using PapaParse
- Add a pop-up with at least 2 fields from the Google Form.

## Extra credit

- Add buttons based on the spreadsheet data
- Add your own array of data and loop through it.

## Submission

- Commit your changes to GitHub
