!!! information "⌛ Reading time ⌛"
    - 20 - 30 minutes

The readings this week are designed to show development (and lack) of ethics from the past and to the present. Jeremmy Krampton's paper shows a past view of GIS and ethics in 1995, while Paris Marx's article describes the lack of a systematic approach to view social problems with technology in "Don’t Blame Social Media. Blame Capitalism."
