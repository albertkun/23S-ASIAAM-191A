# üìùLab Assignment #3 - User Experience and GeoJSON

## Due 4/28

In this week's lab, we learned how to add buttons and a styled GeoJSON to our map. Your assignment this week has two parts:

1. Part A - Create a map that will pan to certain makers when a button is clicked.
2. Part B - Create a map that is based off of a GeoJSON and style the GeoJSON.

For this assignment you can submit each map separately, for example as `week3a` and `week3b`. Or you can bundle them together as `week3` for extra credit.

## Requirements for Part A

- Add at least 3 markers to the map using a [JavaScript function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/Function) (these markers can be same as lab assignment #2)
- Use the [`<button>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) to execute a JavaScript function to interact with your map 
- Add an [Event Listener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener) that executes the JavaScript function to interact with your map 

## Requirements for Part B
- Add a styled GeoJSON to your map (this can be combined with the markers from Part A for extra credit)

### Extra Credit

- Combine both maps into one page with a common theme
- Use something else like images or text to move the map.
- Try something new with the [Leaflet API](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html)
