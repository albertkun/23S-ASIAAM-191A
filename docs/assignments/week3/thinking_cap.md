# Thinking cap #3

    ## How are closed source tools harmful for civil society? What about open source tools? Where do you think Artificial Intelligence (AI) fits into this?

Reflect on the implications of the tools that we chose for digital mapping and how that may impact civil society. Think about why focusing on closed source tools is a good or bad thing. Similarly, think about the pros and cons of open source tools and how recent developments in AI may effect our approach to digital mapping.

Reviewing the readings, lecture, and discussion notes is helpful in formulating a response.
