# üìùLab Assignment #1 - Map Portfolio

## Due 4/13
Time to put your skills to the test and create a home page for the individual maps that you will be making this quarter. Describe some of your interests. This is your portfolio, so feel free to delete or add anything. If you made multiple HTML pages, please link them all to the `index.html` using the `<a href=""></a>` tag>.

Your map portfolio must contain the following:

- A [`<h1>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) for your title
- A `<h2>` or [`<h3>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) to create a title for a sub-section about your interests. 
- A [`<p>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p) for a paragraph describing yourself and your goals as a critical digital map maker.
- Style CSS by changing the background color, font, or anything else.
- Use an ordered list [`<ol>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) and an unordered list [`<ul>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) to list things.
- Include an [`<img>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) with a photo of yourself or an avatar. Feel free to add other images too to give some flavor to your page, like food or desserts.
- Use the [`<a>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) to add a link to 2 other web pages.
- {--Add at least 2-3 markers to the map with a common theme, for example organizations you've volunteered for or places you've traveled.--} (removed due to running out of time for lab)
- Set up [GitHub pages](../../help/submit.md) for your repo

###  Submission

- Commit and publish your file to your repo's [GitHub pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)
- Find your `index.html` in the `week1` folder and copy the URL. It should look something like this:

### Extra Credit: (any of these)
