# Updating the Lab Assignment repo
### Requirements:
- [Forked Lab Assignment repo guide completed](../help/git_forking.md)

This guide will walk you through how to update the forked lab assignment repo. 

## Open the Lab Assignment repository
In VS Code find and open the folder for the lab assignment repository.
![./media/open_repo_2.png](media/open_repo_2.png)

If you recently worked on the lab you can find it in the **"Recent"** section like so:
![./media/open_repo.png](media/open_repo.png)

Checking the Remote Upstream
To make sure that the remote upstream is correct, run the command:
>`git remote --v`

The `origin` should be set to your account, while the `upstream` to be set to the instructors account `albertkun`:

![./media/remote_check.png](media/remote_check.png)

### Wrong upstream?
If you have the wrong upstream, remove the current `upstream` by running: 
>`git remote rm upstream`

And then add the correct upstream by running:
>`git remote add upstream https://github.com/albertkun/21S-ASIAAM-191A-Assignments.git`

## Update the repo
As with every week, start with pulling from the main repository by running:

>`git pull upstream main`

It should look something similar to this:
![./media/pull_success.png](media/pull_success.png)

Open the Explorer tab in the activity bar to see if the new week has appeared:
![./media/git_fetch_explorer.png](media/git_fetch_explorer.png)

If it has, then congratulations, it should look something like this:
![./media/week_2.png](media/week_2.png)
