After installing Live Share, you can join a session with these steps:

## 2. Sign in to GitHub

Click on the `Live Share` status bar item **or** press `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P` and select the `Live Share: Sign In With Browser` command.

## 3. Working the session
After you join, you'll be immediately presented with the file that the "host" has open, and can see their cursor and any edits they make.

## 4. Snapping windows
To make our editing session more efficient, it is highly recommended that **after** you join the live coding session, that you open a new window for VS Code and snap one window to the left and another to the right.

The ideal layout should look something like the following:
